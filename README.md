Route Grower
============

Explores so you don't have to. 

Route Grower will create routes for you of a given distance and elevation gain.

# Motivation

When you ride a lot, you're often building new routes to explore on your rides. 
This can be incredibly time consuming. Route grower attempts to automate this
process and will eventually feed in data from riding heat maps, segment popularity,
road conditions, etc.

# Usage

Using route grower is as simple as `python grower.py`
