Route Grower
============

Explores so you don't have to. 

Route Grower will create routes for you of a given distance and elevation gain.

Eventually, we'll add support so that Route Grower can use previous data 
(i.e. your previous rides) to determine which types of roads you like,
and generate the course accordingly.
